Last year, for example, we had participants from over 60 different countries and counselors from 25 different nations. Of course, we don't know where they will come from this year. So we are at least as excited as you are.\n\nThrough our office in Hamburg and our branch office in Canada, we reach motivated and committed counselors from all over the world. Canadian and Australian teamers can therefore be found as well as German or Spanish teamers.\n\nDue to the different experiences and cultural backgrounds an indescribably fantastic, international atmosphere is created."

As we have our headquarters in Germany, German teamers are always present in all camps in Germany. All announcements and explanations are here therefore always in German and English. Of course, all our teamers with their different nationalities are also available for individual translations."

          "title": "Are there problems if children have low language skills?",
          "description": "No, because there are usually more participants and team members who speak the same language. We know from experience that children are excellent at communicating nonverbally. They often need a few days to warm up to it, but are then very open to other children as well."

However, the maximum capacity is not reached every week. However, a minimum number of participants must be guaranteed in order to run the camp.\n\nIt is important to us that all children are always grouped in small groups of 5-8, with a counselor as a contact person. This way homesickness doesn't stand a chance and despite the size of the camp in their group family, they experience a strong bond on which they can count on!"

In principle, no extra additional courses have to be booked. A program with a variety of activities is of course available to the participants in all camps. The various activities can be chosen by the participants on site in the respective camps. We present the offers to the participants, so that everyone gets an insight into the different courses.

On this hike the participants will not spend the night in a tent, but either in the open air or under a self-made shelter e.g. from tarpaulins. They will of course be accompanied by their teamers. The hike is a very special experience and a highlight for all participants. For this hike the participants need sturdy shoes and a big backpack."

This service can be booked upon registration for three-week camps. Please note that the laundry will be done either after one week or after two weeks."

Follow our tips and your child will have a fantastic holiday, have many new experiences and make friends from all over the world! All these tips have been developed together with the International Camping Fellowship.

We conduct a personal interview with each individual in which our employees get a first impression of the applicant.\n\nBefore the camp season, everyone, both the first supervisors (teamers) as well as many recomers, complete a one-week training in which they are prepared for their assignment by trained coaches. They must have a first aid certificate, which may not be older than two years, as well as an internationally flawless police clearance certificate.

Due to our cooperation with the association \"Keine Macht den Drogen\" (No power to drugs) and our common opinion that all kinds of drugs do not belong in the hands of children & teenagers, any possession or consumption of drugs is forbidden for teenagers and children in the camp and also outside the camp.\n\nViolations can lead to exclusion or even to criminal charges. The term \"drugs\" also includes cigarettes and alcohol! Through our varied activities, we offer a much better alternative! We would like to make it clear from the outset that we are also against any form of discrimination or \"putting down\". This is - just like violence - immediately prevented by us, in order to offer each young person a relaxed and joyful time in the camp."

          "description": "We ask all parents to write to their child at least once. This is especially useful at the beginning, as it is a particularly upsetting experience for every child and every teenager when most of the participants receive a letter, but they do not.\n\nPlease note that there is NO public \"camp phone\" available for incoming or outgoing calls. If your child doesn't bring her/his own phone, she/he won't be able to call you. In case of any problems, we will of course contact you immediately.\n\nIf your child brings a mobile phone, we will collect it on arrival and store it with the valuables. Your child's Teamer may hand it over during the phone time after lunch. Please keep in mind: no news is good news (the location manager will contact you if it is necessary due to homesickness or illness). We kindly ask you not to call the office in Hamburg to ask about your kid's health and wellbeing, nor if you would like to know why your child hasn't called you yet. Please use our camp email service for such enquiries.\n\nOur recommendation is the following:\nWe recommend not to call your child (even if he or she has a mobile phone with him or her) and not to tell him or her to call you. Telephoning can in our experience promote homesickness very strongly and your child will be cured thereby if completely immersed in camp life! At noon after lunch, if absolutely necessary, your child can pick up his or her mobile phone from the counselors until the start of next program and make phone calls. Instead, you are welcome to bring a pre-stamped and addressed envelope with you. We will then make sure that your child has enough time to write letters. Since letters and postcards often arrive late at the camps, we also offer the e-mail service. You can send your child max. ONE email per day directly to the camp, which we then print out and give to your child. There is no way for them to reply, but your child will be happy to receive a small message from home. You can find the postal and email address in the info package of the booked camp."

They must also have a \"First Aid Certificate\", which must not be older than two years. In the camps we try to make sure that only adults from our camp or familiar faces are on the campground and that all our carers look after strangers.\n\nWe have many different camp sites. Some of them are fenced in, others are not. There are no armed guards or the like in our camps, as we believe that these conditions create a very insecure feeling.

It is therefore necessary for each participant to take their insurance card with them to the camp. We offer all participants the possibility of taking out liability, casualty & health insurance for travel abroad with us. This covers all costs in case of illness and prevents international children in particular from having to \"advance\" their own cash.
